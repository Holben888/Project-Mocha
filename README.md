## Setting up the project

When cloning this repository, clone it into some parent folder titled whatever you like (would recommend this repository name, "Project-Mocha")

Set up your python virtual environment in the folder you just cloned this repository to. This allows you to add libraries to this Django project without affecting any files outside of this project.
To do so, follow these steps:
* Install virtualenv for the project using: sudo easy_install virtualenv (look up windows equivalent if needed)
* Create virtual environment within project folder using: virtualenv [ENV_NAME]
* Activate environment using: source [ENV_NAME]/bin/activate
    * Once activated, you may now safely run terminal commands on the project and run it
    
Run using: python manage.py runserver

### That's all! Happy hacking :)
